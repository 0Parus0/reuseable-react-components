**_ Handling Controlled Inputs In React _**

1. Create a new piece of state
2. Create an event handler to watch for the 'onChange' event
3. When the 'onChange' event fires, get the value from input
4. Take that value from the input and use it to update your state
5. Pass your state to the input as the value prop.
